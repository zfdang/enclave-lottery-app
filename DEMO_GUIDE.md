## ðŸ”§ File Structure (After Consolidation)

### Active Demo Files
- **`demo.sh`** - Main demo launcher script
- **`lottery_demo.py`** - Unified Python demo system
- **`scripts/comprehensive_demo.sh`** - Advanced web-based demo (optional)

### Removed Files (Consolidated)
- ~~`run_demo.sh`~~ - Replaced by `demo.sh`
- ~~`enclave/quick_demo.py`~~ - Functionality moved to `lottery_demo.py`
- ~~`enclave/quick_demo_fixed.py`~~ - Functionality moved to `lottery_demo.py`
- ~~`scripts/quick_demo.sh`~~ - Functionality moved to `lottery_demo.py`

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: "ModuleNotFoundError" when running demo**
A: Ensure running from correct directory. The new demo.sh sets Python path automatically.

**Q: Demo interruption or exceptions**
A: The new system includes better error handling. Use Ctrl+C to safely exit.

**Q: Want to customize demo parameters**
A: Edit configuration in `lottery_demo.py` in the `__init__` method.

### Technical Support
