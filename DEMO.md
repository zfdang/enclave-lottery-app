## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: "Could not connect to blockchain" error**
A: Ensure a local blockchain is running on `http://localhost:8545`. Start Anvil with:
```bash
# Install Anvil (part of Foundry)
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup

# Start local blockchain
anvil
```

**Q: "Contract artifacts not found" error**
A: Ensure Solidity contracts are compiled. Run the setup script:
```bash
./scripts/setup_environment.sh
```

**Q: "Insufficient balance for deployment" error**
A: The default test account should have ETH. If using custom RPC, fund the deployer account.

**Q: "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'web3'" when running demo**
A: Install blockchain dependencies:
```bash
pip3 install web3 eth-account
# Or install all enclave requirements:
pip3 install -r enclave/requirements.txt
```

**Q: Demo interruption or exceptions**
A: The system includes comprehensive error handling. Use Ctrl+C to safely exit.

**Q: Want to use existing smart contract**
A: Set `contract_address` in `enclave/config/enclave.conf` to your contract address.

### Blockchain Troubleshooting
1. **Check Blockchain Connection**: Verify `http://localhost:8545` is accessible
2. **Verify Contract Deployment**: Check `deployment.json` for contract address
3. **Gas Issues**: Ensure sufficient ETH balance for transactions
4. **Network Issues**: Verify chain ID matches configuration (default: 31337)
